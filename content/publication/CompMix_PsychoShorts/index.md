abstract: Bilingual children hear sentences that contain words from both languages, also known as code-switching (Kremin et al., 2020). Investigating how bilinguals process code-switching is a crucial component in understanding bilingual language acquisition, because bilinguals experience processing costs and reduced comprehension when encountering code-switched nouns (e.g., Can you find the chien?; Byers-Heinlein et al., 2017; Potter et al., 2019). Studies have yet to investigate if processing costs are present when toddlers encounter code-switches at other syntactic locations within a sentence. Therefore, the current study examined how young bilinguals process sentences with code-switches at an adjective before the target noun. <br> Thirty bilingual toddlers (age range: 37 – 48 months) learning English and French or English and Spanish participated. Participants sat in front of a screen that simultaneously displayed a target and distractor image and heard either a sentence with code-switching at the adjective before the target noun (e.g., “Can you find la jolie cow?) or a single language sentence (e.g., “Can you find the pretty cow?”).

# summary: A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone
#  user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person
#  wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based
#  ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail
#  store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items
#  can be tried on.
