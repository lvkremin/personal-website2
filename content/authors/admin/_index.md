I have over 9 years of research experience. In my research I have drawn on a range of methods including moderated usability testing, surveys, competitive benchmarking, eye-tracking, interviews, and online experiments. I enjoy working with my team to answer questions about how people think and what they know. 

I recently completed my PhD in Psychology at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. My academic research focused on language acquisition in bilingual children.

Outside of my research, I enjoy practicing and teaching yoga, traveling, spending time with my dog, and occassionally knitting.

Please do not hesitate to [contact](https://www.lenavkremin.com/#contact) me if you have any questions relating to my work.
