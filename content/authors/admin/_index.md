I am currently a PhD candidate in Psychology at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada.

My main research interest is **language acquisition in bilingual children**, particularly how bilingual infants **separate** their languages. I’m currently involved in projects investigating parental language mixing, word learning, and the potential effects of code-switching on comprehension.

Outside of my research, I enjoy practicing and teaching yoga, travelling, spending time with my dog, and occassionally knitting.

Please do not hesitate to [contact](https://www.lenavkremin.com/#contact) me if you have any questions relating to my research.
