title: Do bilinguals have separate phonological systems?
---

This project focuses on whether or not bilinguals have different phonological systems for each of their lanugages. Current work is investigating if adults perceive sounds differently depending of what language they're hearing. Future work will extend this research to bilingual toddlers.
