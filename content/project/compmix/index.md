Bilingual children hear sentences that contain words from both languages, also known as code-switching. Investigating how bilinguals process code-switching is a crucial component in understanding bilingual language acquisition, because bilinguals experience processing costs and reduced comprehension when encountering code-switched nouns (e.g., Can you find the *chien*?). Studies have yet to investigate if processing costs are present when toddlers encounter code-switches at other syntactic locations within a sentence. Therefore, this project examins how young bilinguals process sentences with code-switches at an adjective before the target noun.
